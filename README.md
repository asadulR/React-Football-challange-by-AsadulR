# Getting Started with Create React App

# [React Challenge Live Demo](https://football-react-asadul.netlify.app/)


- This app is for a job task provided by Koneksys. First of all I would link to say that this challenge was a good practice for me using my skills. It seems very interesting to me. But I'm sorry to say that I didn't complete all the features. Because of natural flood in Bangladesh at Sylhet I did't get enough electricity. This is a record breaking flood in the history. I tried my best to develope this site when electricity was available. I believe that I have the capablity to develope a modern web application using React.js. Thank you.
